# Testing Guide

## Commands

- Run all tests:
  - `npm run test`
- Focused run (Lesson 01 example):
  - `npm run test:serializer`

## Coverage Policy

- Focus coverage on files touched by the lesson (avoid unrelated noise).
- Configure per-lesson thresholds if needed.

## TDD Cycle

1. Red: Write failing tests describing behavior.
2. Green: Minimal implementation to pass.
3. Refactor: Improve names/structure without changing behavior.
4. Learn: Document decisions in Architecture Decisions.
